<H1 ID="intro">Introduction</H1>

Welcome to <em>Yaps</em>, Yet Another Paging Package. The program is used
to send textual messages to a remote paging device using a modem gateway.
Many pager companies offer such modem gateways and are using specific
protocols. The most often used one, TAP is implemented beside others (more
or less complete.) This command line program uses a global and a private
configuration file to get information about each paging service, installed
modems and possibly other.<P>

As the main part is implemented as a library it is not very complicated to
write a client/server solution. For the legal status see the File
<a href="COPYING.GPL">Copying</a>.


<H1 ID="install">Installation</H1>

The software is written, tested and designed on and for Unix(tm) like
operating systems and requires the so called Posix system calls and function
library. Gnumake and GCC are required, too (or some changes to the Makefile
and the code may be neccessary.) It is known to run at least on following
operating systems:
<Ul Compact>
<Li> <a href="http://www.linux.org/">Linux</a> (native system)
<Li> <a href="http://www.sun.com/">Solaris 2.5.1</a> (Frank K&auml;fer)
<Li> <a href="http://www.sun.com/">SunOS 4.1.3 aka Solaris 1.1</a> (Frank
K&auml;fer)
</Ul>
(more may follow.)<P>

Typically these steps should be enough to install the package:
<Dl>
<Dt> Edit Config
<Dd> For GCC the settings of CC and CFLAGS should be okay. Define
<strong>SLANG=True</strong>, if you like to use the SLang scripting
language, which can be found on
<a href="ftp://space.mit.edu/pub/davis/slang/">space.mit.edu</a>. Install it
somewhere the compiler can find it. Define <strong>LUA=True</strong> for
using the lua scripting language, which is located on
<a href="ftp://ftp.icad.puc-rio.br/pub/lua">ftp.icad.puc-rio.br</a>. READ
THE COPYRIGHT RELATED FILES OF EACH PACKAGE BEFORE INSTALLING IT!
<Dt> Edit config.h
<Dd> This is used to adapt the software to various variants of Unix(tm). If
you do not have a regex.h file, either set HAVE_REGEX_T to zero or install
the GNU regular expression library. Be sure the library and includefile can
be found by the compiler and the name of the header file is
<em>regex.h</em>, otherwise make a (symbolic) link to this file. Add the
libary to <em>EXLIB =</em> in Config.
<Dt> make depend
<Dd> This create the dependency file which will be included during make.
<Dt> make (or make all)
<Dd> This compiles the library, the program driver and links the program.
The documentation is created using lynx. As lynx is not on every system the
already formated result is included as well.
<Dt> make install
<Dd> This copies the program and the global configuration file to the final
location. This step requires a working <em>install</em> program. If this is
missing, you have to install it by hand (well, two files should not be too
much.)
<Dt> Edit the global configuration file
<Dd> With your favorite editor you should edit the global configuration file
(which will be installed as <em>/etc/yaps.rc</em> on default) and change
everything as required. See the <a href="#config">Configuration</a> section
for a detailed description of the contents of the file.
<Dt> Done!
<Dd> You may play around with your configuration until you are satisfied,
but this fine tuning is up to you.
</Dl><P>

If you have problems during compilation, feel free to send me a 
<a href="mailto:yaps@nitmar.tnet.de">mail</a>.


<H1 ID="config">Configuration</H1>

The program reads first the global configuration file <em>/etc/yaps.rc</em>
(when not overwritten by command line switch), then the local one in
<em>~/.yapsrc</em> to get its configuration. Command line options may
overwrite some settings in these files. Both configuration files have the
same layout where the local one can overwrite settings of the global one.
Each file is seperated in sections, where a section is started with
<strong>[&lt;name&gt;]</strong> or <strong>[]</strong> for the global
section. When a file is opened all entries are stored in the global section
until a section name appears. If a section expression [..] is followed by a
comma seperate list of names, then these are the fallback sections, i.e.
variables not found int his section are taken from the fallback sections
before trying the global one.<P>

If the first character is a bar (<strong>|</strong>) then the rest is taken
as a filename to be included at this point. The current section is
<strong>NOT</strong> affected by this call.

Each line may have exactly one entry (or a comment starting with a hash sign
in the first column) where the variable name is seperated by whitespaces
from its value. If the first character of the value is a backslash
(<strong>\</strong>), then this is removed. This allowes creating values
starting with whitespaces. But if a value should start with a backslash
itself, be sure to escape it with another backslash. A line can split over
several physical line, if each line (expect the last one) ends with a
backslash. If the value starts with an opening curly bracket (<em>{</em>)
then all lines up to the closing curly bracket (<em>}</em>) in the first
column are taken as the value for that variable. The brackets (and the lines
where they appear) are not part of the value.<P>

The value may either be textual, numeric, boolean or a check expression.
Textual values are starting with the first non whitespace character and
continue to the end of the line. Numeric values are a sequence of digits
which are parsed by the C-function <em>atoi(3)</em>. Boolean may either be
<em>T</em>, <em>Y</em>, <em>1</em> or <em>+</em> for true and <em>F</em>,
<em>N</em>, <em>0</em> or <em>-</em> for false (or in greater detail,
everything that is not true is false.) Case is here not significant. The
check is a sequence of special characters which must match the given string.
If a <em>&gt;</em> is found, then the rest is optional, but must still
match, if a <em>&lt;</em> is found and the string is not at its end, it is
considered as too long. These characters are supported:
<Ul Compact>
<Li> <em>1</em> numeric
<Li> <em>h</em> hexadecimal
<Li> <em>l</em> lowercase
<Li> <em>u</em> uppercase
<Li> <em>a</em> alpha
<Li> <em>n</em> alphanumeric
<Li> <em>p</em> printable
<Li> <em>x</em> ascii
<Li> every other character matches every character
</Ul>
Some simple examples:
<Ul Compact>
<Li> <strong>&gt;1</strong> A string with unlimited length, but made only
out of numeric values.
<Li> <strong>aaa</strong> A string of exact three alpha characters.
<Li> <strong>&gt;xxxx&lt;</strong> A string of length zero up to four made
of ASCII characters.
<Li> <strong>....&gt;1111&lt;</strong> A string starting with exact four
characters, followed by zero to four numeric characters.
</Ul>

Alternative one can specify the check by a description, if the checkstring
is prefixed by a plus sign. This is then a comma seperated list of checks,
which are seperated by an equal sign into variable and value. These
variables are supported:
<Ul>
<Li> <strong>type=&lt;type&gt;</strong> Each character in the string must
match the type, which may be one of the following:
     <Ul Compact>
     <Li> <strong>numeric</strong> only digits are allowed.
     <Li> <strong>sedecimal</strong> only hexdigits are allowed.
     <Li> <strong>lower</strong> only lowercase characters are allowed.
     <Li> <strong>upper</strong> only uppercase characters are allowed.
     <Li> <strong>alpha</strong> only alpha characters are allowed.
     <Li> <strong>alphanumeric</strong> only digits and alpha characters are
	  allowed.
     <Li> <strong>print</strong> only printable characters are allowed.
     <Li> <strong>ascii</strong> only ASCII characters are allowed.
     </Ul>
<Li> <strong>length=&lt;length&gt;</strong> The string must have exact this
length.
<Li> <strong>minimum=&lt;length&gt;</strong> The string must at least this
length.
<Li> <strong>maximum=&lt;length&gt;</strong> The string must not be longer
than this length.
</Ul>
<P>

The global section defines global values or default values for other
sections. Some section may not inherit these values, but currently there is
only one and is marked as such.<P>

<H2>Global section</H2>

These are typical found in the global section and can be overwritten in
other sections, if required.

<Dl>
<Dt> services &lt;text&gt;
<Dd> This is the comma seperated list of available services.
<Dt> call-id &lt;text&gt;
<Dd> If the pager allows to send the source caller id this id is used, if
not overwritten by a command line argument.
<Dt> signature &lt;text&gt;
<Dd> If this is present, then the text is appended to each message sent to
the pager (and if use-signature is True).
<Dt> verbose &lt;num&gt;
<Dd> Sets the debugging/verbosity level. The bigger the number, the more
output is generated.
<Dt> logfile &lt;text&gt;
<Dd> If the given text is a valid filename the status of a sending request
is loged there.
<Dt> <a ID="logstr"></a>logstring &lt;text&gt;
<Dd> If this is present, then only these parts are logged, which match the
given string. Currently these elements are supported:
     <Ul Plain Compact>
     <Li> <strong>+</strong> message had been trasmitted successfully
     <Li> <strong>-</strong> message had not been transmitted
     <Li> <strong>*</strong> part had been transmitted successfully
     <Li> <strong>/</strong> part had not been transmitted
     <Li> <strong>i</strong> informal logfile entry
     <Li> <strong>c</strong> cost relevant informations
     <Li> <strong>s</strong> session start
     <Li> <strong>e</strong> session end
     <Li> <strong>p</strong> protocol specific
     </Ul>
<Dt> modems &lt;text&gt;
<Dd> This is a list of modem entries, seperated by commas.
<Dt> final-report &lt;text&gt;
<Dd> If this is set, a final report is written to the given filename. If
filename is <strong>-</strong>, then it is written to stdout. This feature
is intended for use in shell scripts, so the script could proof which
message has actual send and which one has been rejected instead of simple
rely on the return code of yaps.
</Dl>

<H2>Service section</H2>

The names of these section are free to the user, but their contents describe
a paging service (or a paging company.) Following variables are allowed for
service sections:

<Dl>
<Dt> speed &lt;num&gt;
<Dd> The speed of the serial device.
<Dt> bits-per-byte &lt;num&gt;
<Dd> The number of bits per byte, supported are 5 to 8.
<Dt> parity &lt;text&gt;
<Dd> The used parity, this may either be <em>n</em>one, <em>e</em>ven or
<em>o</em>dd.
<Dt> stopbits &lt;num&gt;
<Dd> The number of stopbits, supported are 1 or 2.
<Dt> phone &lt;text&gt;
<Dd> The phone number of the modem gateway for this service. If the number
contains <strong>%P</strong> and <em>insert-pager-id</em> is set, then the
pagerid is inserted into the phonenumber.
<Dt> protocol &lt;text&gt;
<Dd> This is the communication protocol, that this service requires.
Currently are <em>ascii</em>, <em>script</em>, <em>tap</em> and <em>ucp</em>
allowed.
<Dt> max-size &lt;num&gt;
<Dd> The maximal length of a message for this service.
<Dt> may-split &lt;bool&gt;
<Dd> If this is true, then a message, which is too long will be split into
several messages.
<Dt> max-messages &lt;num&gt;
<Dd> The maximum number of messages per message, that can be send. If this
is zero, then an unlimited number of messages can be send.
<Dt> truncate &lt;bool&gt;
<Dd> If this is set a message is not split, but truncated to the length
allowed by the provider.
<Dt> use-call-id &lt;bool&gt;
<Dd> If this is true, then the caller-id is inserted. Where it is insert is
protocol specific.
<Dt> use-signature &lt;bool&gt;
<Dd> If this is true and a signature is given, this is appended to each
message.
<Dt> insert-pager-id &lt;bool&gt;
<Dd> If this is true, then the pagerid is inserted as part of the phone
number. This implies, that only messages to the same receipiant can be send
at one call.
<Dt> rm-invalids-cid &lt;text&gt;
<Dd> Remove every character in <em>text</em>, that appears in the caller id.
This is designed to make a caller id more readable, but still useable by the
desired service.
<Dt> rm-invalids-pid &lt;text&gt;
<Dd> Dito for pager ids.
<Dt> valid-pid &lt;text&gt;
<Dd> This is a regular expression to check wether a pager-id is valid for
this service. If your system does not support Posix regular expression, you
can use a simple replacement. This is just a list of strings, seperated by a
bar which must match the beginning of the pager-id.
<Dt> change-pid &lt;text&gt;
<Dd> If the pager-id matches the regular expression of <em>valid-pid</em>,
then this matching part is replaced with this string. If the string is just
a minus (<em>-</em>), then the match is removed from the resulting pager-id.
<Dt> valid-cid &lt;text&gt;
<Dd> The same like <em>valid-pid</em> for the caller id.
<Dt> change-cid &lt;text&gt;
<Dd> The same like <em>change-pid</em> for the caller id.
<Dt> conv-table &lt;text&gt;
<Dd> The value is a filename to a character conversion table. This affects
only the message (and depending on the protocol the pagerid) and allows
transforming illegal characters to valid ones.
<Dt> convert &lt;text&gt;
<Dd> This is comma seperated list of direct change entries of the convertion
table. If you want to include more than one pair, the block construct using
curly brackets (<em>{..}</em>) must be used. Each line contains a source and
a destination character, i.e. if the source character is encountered in a
message, the destination character is used for it. There are also some
predefined convertion rules, which all starts with an asterisk:
     <Ul Compact>
     <Li> <strong>*no-control</strong> control characters are suppressed
     <Li> <strong>*control</strong> control characters are inserted literal
     <Li> <strong>*no-8bit</strong> no characters with 8'th bit set are
          included
     <Li> <strong>*8bit</strong> use also characters with 8'th bit set.
     <Li> <strong>*numeric</strong> only numeric characters are allowed.
     </Ul>
<Dt> cost &lt;text&gt;
<Dd> This string is used to calculate the costs for each call. The
description is a comma seperated list of variables with equal sign seperated
optional value. These variables are currently implemented:
     <Dl Compact>
     <Dt> fixed
     <Dd> This tells the software, that the cost are fixed per call, i.e.
	  no real calculation takes place according to the used entities.
     <Dt> entity-length=&lt;entity&gt;
     <Dd> This is the length of one entity. This is interpreted as a
	  floating point number.
     <Dt> max-entities=&lt;count&gt;
     <Dd> Some providers only charge until a maximum of entites had
	  been used and stop then charging.
     <Dt> dial-overhead=&lt;seconds&gt;
     <Dd> The counter starts before dialing. Typically it takes some
	  time from dialing to the first billed entity. This time can
	  be specified using this variable.
     <Dt> cost=&lt;cost&gt;
     <Dd> This is the cost per entity (or the whole cost on fixed charging
	  services). This is a floating point number.
     <Dt> unit=&lt;string&gt;
     <Dd> This string is appended in the logfile for the currency. This is
	  only of cosmetic value.
     <Dt> remainder=&lt;digits&gt;
     <Dd> This is the number of digits after the point in the cost display.
	  This value is typical two.
     <Dt> timetable=&lt;description&gt;
     <Dd> If a timetable entry is given, then the cost are calculated
	  depending on weekday and time. On fixed charging services the
	  value describes the complete costs for the call, in the other
	  case the value is the entity-length for this day/time. The
	  description is a semi-colon seperated list of single entries of
	  the form:<BR>
<strong>&lt;Weekday(s)&gt;&lt;from&gt;-&lt;to&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</strong><BR>
	  Each weekday is a two letter sequence (So, Mo, Tu, We, Th, Fr, Sa)
	  and there are three special &quot;weekdays&quot;: <em>Wk</em> for
	  working days (monday to friday), <em>Ss</em> for weekend
	  (saturday and sunday) and <em>al</em> for all days. A typical
	  example may look like:
	  <strong>Wk0800-1800=12;Wk1800-0800=24;Ss=24</strong>, but this
	  could be written shorter as:
	  <strong>=24;Wk0800-1800=12</strong> because the first entry is
	  taken as the default, if no match is found. And the construct
	  <em>=24</em> does not contain any weekday, so it is invalid for
	  any regular check.
     </Dl>
<Dt> force &lt;bool&gt;
<Dd> If a feature is requested, but this service do not support it, the
message will still be delivered, if this variable is set to True.
<Dt> can-delay &lt;bool&gt;
<Dd> Set this to True, if the service provider accepts a delay for sending
the message.
<Dt> can-expire &lt;bool&gt;
<Dd> Set this to True, if the service provider allowes the setting of an
expiration timestamp.
<Dt> can-rds &lt;bool&gt;
<Dd> Set this to True, if the service provider allowes the request for a
delivery status.
<Dt> rds &lt;bool&gt;
<Dd> Set this to True, if <em>can-rds</em> is True and you always want to
get a delivery status.
<Dt> check-call-id &lt;check&gt;
<Dd> The caller id must match the <strong>check</strong> expression.
<Dt> check-pager-id &lt;check&gt;
<Dd> Each pager id must match the <strong>check</strong> expression.
</Dl>

<H2>Modem section</H2>

Each modem should have its own section. Following entries are currently
supported:

<Dl>
<Dt> device &lt;text&gt;
<Dd> The filename for the device where the modem is attached to.
	  If the CAPI interface should be used, the parameter <text>
	  must be coded as 
	     capi/&lt;controller&gt;/&lt;MSN&gt;
	  Note, there must not be a '/' at the beginning, when using CAPI.
<Dt> lock-prefix &lt;text&gt;
<Dd> This is the pathname to prefix the basename of the modemdevice to
create lockfiles. This can be used to enable more than one application to
use the modem.
	  Not used by CAPI.
<Dt> lock-method &lt;text&gt;
<Dd> This is a comma seperated list of locking mechanism. Currently these
flags are supported:
     <Ul Compact>
     <Li> <em>ascii</em> PID is stored as ASCII text in lockfile.
     <Li> <em>binary</em> PID is stored in machine representation in
	  lockfile. 
     <Li> <em>lower</em> converts device part of lockfile to lower case.
     <Li> <em>upper</em> converts device part of lockfile to upper case.
     <Li> <em>sysv4</em> append SysV4 style infos to lockfile instead of the
	  basename of the device.
     <Li> <em>timeout=&lt;secs&gt;</em> tries to lock the device
	  <strong>secs</strong> seconds.
     </Ul>
	  Not used by CAPI.
<Dt> init &lt;text&gt;
<Dd> This is the init sequence to initialize the modem.
	  Not used by CAPI.
<Dt> dial &lt;text&gt;
<Dd> This is the dial sequence to dial a phone number with the modem. An
<strong>\L</strong> in the string will be replaced by the phone number.
	  If the CAPI interface is used, this entry just defines a
	  possible needed prefix to dial out, e.g. '0'.
<Dt> timeout &lt;num&gt;
<Dd> This is the default timeout to wait for responses of the modem.
	  Not used by CAPI.
<Dt> reset &lt;text&gt;
<Dd> This is the sequence to reset the modem.
	  Not used by CAPI.
<Dt> local-init &lt;text&gt;
<Dd> This is used to customize an existing modem entry for different purpose
(e.g. force a specific connect rate, etc.)
	  Not used by CAPI.
</Dl>

Beside this the section may contain protocol specific entries to adapt the
protocol for this service.

<H2>ASCII based protocol</H2>

A <strong>\C</strong> is replaced with the caller id, if available. If
request a delivery report is switched on, a <strong>\R</strong> is replaced
with <em>1</em>, else with <em>0</em>.

<Dt> script-name &lt;text&gt;
<Dd> This is the name (e.g. the name of the variable containing) the script.
If the name starts with a slash or a plus sign, then the value is treated as
a filename from where the script should be read. The plus sign is stripped
off before opening the file.
<Dt> scr-login &lt;text&gt;
<Dd> This is the function/label where to start at login. If the caller id is
available (and the language supports it) the caller id is passed as an
argument.
<Dt> scr-logout &lt;text&gt;
<Dd> Dito for logout.
<Dt> scr-pagerid &lt;text&gt;
<Dd> Dito for sending the pagerid. The pagerid is passed as an argument.

<H2>Alias section</H2>

The entries in this section are not able to access the global entries. Each
entry contains an alias name with its real number.


<H1 ID="cmdline">Command Line</H1>

Yaps support several command line parameter which can overwrite the possibly
used default values in the configuration files. Following options are
understood by this program (on some systems, there are is also support for
long options):

<Dl>
<Dt> -C &lt;configfile&gt;, --config=&lt;configfile&gt;
<Dd> Use <strong>cfgfile</strong> instead of the default global
configuration file <em>/etc/yaps.rc</em>.
<Dt> -s &lt;service&gt;, --service=&lt;service&gt;
<Dd> Use paging service <strong>service</strong> instead of the default of
the configuration file.
<Dt> -t, --truncate
<Dd> If this is set, then a message is truncated, if it is longer than the
allowed limit of the choosen service.
<Dt> -c &lt;callid&gt;, --call-id=&lt;callid&gt;
<Dd> Use <strong>callid</strong> as the caller id.
<Dt> -S &lt;signature&gt;, --signature=&lt;signature&gt;
<Dd> If signature appending is enabled by the service, use this string as
the signature.
<Dt> -l &lt;logfile&gt;, --logfile=&lt;logfile&gt;
<Dd> Write status of transmission to <strong>logfile</strong>.
<Dt> -L &lt;logstr&gt;, --logstring=&lt;logstr&gt;

<a href="#logstr">above</a> unter the configuration entry
<em>logstring</em> for a detailed description.
<Dt> -f, --force
<Dd> Force sending of messages, even if -d/-e/-r is not supported by the
service.
<Dt> -d &lt;date&gt;, --delay=&lt;date&gt;
<Dd> If the service supports it, the message is delayed and sent at
<strong>date</strong>.
<Dt> -e &lt;date&gt;, --expire=&lt;date&gt;
<Dd> If the service supports it, the message is deleted, if this date is
reached and the message had not been transmitted until then.
<Dt> -r, --request-delivery-status
<Dd> If the service supports it, a delivery status is requested.
<Dt> -R &lt;fname&gt;, --final-report=&lt;fname&gt;
<Dd> A final report is written to <em>fname</em> (or stdout, if fname is
<strong>-</strong>.) This feature is useful to check which message had been
delivered successfully or not.
<Dt> -z &lt;fname&gt;, --message-file=&lt;fname&gt;
<Dd> Reads pager-ids and messages form <em>fname</em>. Each line contains
one pair, seperated by whitespace(s).
<Dt> -v, --verbose
<Dd> Increase the verbosity of yaps, more -v's give more debug output.
<Dt> -p, --print-config
<Dd> This is used to printout configuration values for testing purpose. The
remaining paramters are variables to print out with their value.
</Dl>

Following the options the user has to give receiver/message pairs, all using
the same service. A receiver is either the pager id itself or an alias. If
the first character is a colon, then the colon is cut off and the remaining
part is taken as an alias, if the first character is a slash, it is cut off
as well and the remaining is taken as the pager id. If the first character
is a digit, it is taken as a pager id, otherwise as an alias. It is possible
to specify multiple receiver, if the receiver is a comma seperate list of
individual receivers. If the first character of the message is a plus sign,
then the remaining message is treated as a filename and the real message is
read from this file. If the message is just a minus (<strong>-</strong>),
then the message is read from stdin, if it is just a dot
(<strong>.</strong>), then the message is empty.<P>

The options <em>-d</em> and <em>-e</em> accept a date representation which
must be (according to option parsing) one argument, e.g. if it contains
spaces it must be quoted. If the first character of date is a plus
(<strong>+</strong>) sign, then the date is taken as an offset to the
current time. All further definitions are seperated by spaces:
<Ul>
<Li> &lt;hour&gt;<strong>:</strong>&lt;min&gt;<strong>:</strong>&lt;sec&gt;
<Li> &lt;day&gt;<strong>.</strong>&lt;month&gt;<strong>.</strong>&lt;year&gt;
<Li> &lt;month&gt;<strong>/</strong>&lt;day&gt;<strong>/</strong>&lt;year&gt;
<Li> &lt;numeric&gt; if less than 30 is taken as the hour
<Li> &lt;numeric&gt; if greater or equal than 30 is taken as minutes
</Ul>


<H1 ID="syntax">Sending/Expecting Syntax</H1>

Whenever communication over the serial line takes place the send/expect
functions are comming into play. There are three important functions, which
are called from several parts: sending of data, expecting data and a
send/expect function. Each is explained in detail here (including the
supported syntax):

<H2>Sending</H2>

Sending itself is nothing fancy, just all data will be written to the serial
line.

<H2>Expecting</H2>

Expecting means to wait for some pattern to arrive. It is possible to expect
more than one sequence and the function returns the matching entry, a
timeout or an error condition.

<H2>Send/Expect</H2>

Most communication parts call this function (which then calls the functions
above.) This function requires a string with tokens seperated by
whitespaces. A token may contain whitespaces, if the token is enclosed in
single or double quotes. These quotes (as any other quotes) are removed
during the preparse. The first character of the token is relevant for the
method to be executed. Each token is preparsed to remove/interpret special
characters. Following special characters are interpreted:

<Ul Compact>
<Li> Backslash <strong>\</strong><BR>
The backslash is used to escape any other special character (inclusive
quotes and the backslash itself) or to insert typical control characters.
These are supported:
     <Ul>
     <Li> \a -&gt; Bel
     <Li> \b -&gt; Bs
     <Li> \f -&gt; Ff
     <Li> \l -&gt; Lf
     <Li> \n -&gt; Nl (system depended)
     <Li> \r -&gt; CR
     <Li> \s -&gt; Space
     <Li> \t -&gt; Tab
     </Ul>
<Li> Up arrow <strong>^</strong><BR>
This is used to insert control characters, e.g. ^M means CR.
<Li> Percent <strong>%&lt;nr&gt;</strong><BR>
This inserts optional paramter <strong>nr</strong>, if supplied.
</Ul><P>

These character initiate the behaviour of the token:
<Dl>
<Dt> <strong>&lt;</strong> Expect
<Dd> The rest of the token is for expecting. If the token contains
<strong>-</strong> then the token is split again and each subtoken is
treated as expect/send, if the expect failed. The expect token may be
seperated by <strong>|</strong> to indicate alternatives. The expect is
failed, if an error occurs, a timeout arised or not the first alternatives
matches. The <strong>&lt;</strong> may be appended by a numeric value, which
is used as the timeout in seconds.
<Dt> <strong>!</strong> Command
<Dd> To insert dynamic commands into the sequence use this construct.
Following is an optional numeric value <strong>n</strong> and a command
character. If <strong>n</strong> is not set, its default value is one.
Following characters are supported:
     <Ul>
     <Li> d - sleep <strong>n</strong> seconds
     <Li> D - sleep <strong>n</strong> miliseconds
     <Li> b - send break (length depends on <strong>n</strong> and the
	  implementation)
     <Li> h - hangup the line (lowering DTR by <strong>n</strong> * 0,5
	  seconds.)
     <Li> o - waits for output to drain
     <Li> &lt; - flushes the input queue
     <Li> &gt; - flushes the output queue
     <Li> f - forces the sequence to fail
     <Li> s - forces the sequence to succeed
     </Ul>
<Dt> Any other character
<Dd> This string is just send to the remote side.
</Dl>


<H1 ID="script">Scripting</H1>

Scripting has the advantage (compared to the ASCII protocol) that one is
more flexible. As there are a lot of scripting languages around, there will
be no specific one for this package. As long as such a language is
embeddable into C programs, it should not be too complicate to integrate it
into this package.<P>

This section explains the additional function (or simular) for the available
scripting languages. The syntax itself is explained in the distribution of
each scripting package.

<H2>SLang</H2>

Beside the new functions there is an extension to the string class, so you
can use (beside others) the plus sign to concaternate strings. One time this
part should make its way into the main SLang distribution.

<H3>Variable index</H3>

<Dl>
<Dt> int NO_ERR;
<Dd> This is the return value for a function, that ended successful.
<Dt> int ERR_FAIL;
<Dd> This is the return value for a function, that encountered an error, but
which allowes the script to continue.
<Dt> int ERR_FATAL;
<Dd> Dito, but the script should not continue any more.
<Dt> int ERR_ABORT;
<Dd> Dito, but no further action should take place.
<Dt> int rds;
<Dd> Is set to <em>True</em>, if a delivery status should be requested.
<Dt> int delay_day, delay_mon, delay_year, delay_hour, delay_min, delay_sec;
<Dd> This is the time/date to delay the delivery of the message.
<Dt> int expire_day, expire_mon, expire_year, expire_hour, expire_min, expire_sec;
<Dd> This is the time/date to expire a buffered message.
<Dt> int False;
<Dd> The numeric value for False.
<Dt> int True;
<Dd> Dito for True.
</Dl>

<H3>Function index</H3>

<Dl>
<Dt> void setcb (string func, string sep);
<Dd> This enable the line callback facility and stores each line into a
local variable, which will be overwritten after each new encountered line. A
line is considered as complete, if one character in <strong>sep</strong> is
received. If <strong>func</strong> is the name of a defined function, then
this function is called on every completed new line. The line is passed as
the paramter to this function.
<Dt> void clrcb (void);
<Dd> Clears the line callback facility.
<Dt> string line (void);
<Dd> Returns the last complete read in line, if the line callback facility
is enabled.
<Dt> void hangup (void);
<Dd> Tries to hangup, if the modem is currently off-hook. This is done by
lowering the DTR line.
<Dt> int send (string str);
<Dd> Sends the string to the remote side. Returns <strong>True</strong> on
success, <strong>False</strong> otherwise.
<Dt> int csend (string str);
<Dd> Dito, but the string is converted before it is sended to the remote
side.
<Dt> int expect (int tout, string str1, ..., string strn, int cnt);
<Dd> The function waits <strong>tout</strong> seconds until one of the
strings is received. If no string is received, <strong>0</strong> is
returned, <strong>-1</strong> on error. Otherwise the number of the string
is returned (<strong>1</strong> for <strong>str1</strong>,
<strong>2</strong> for <strong>str2</strong>, etc). <strong>cnt</strong> is
the number of strings to wait for.
<Dt> int send_expect (int tout, string expr);
<Dd> This function executes the <strong>expr</strong> with its internal
send/expect evaluater and returns <strong>True</strong>, when the sequence
had been executed completely, otherwies <strong>False</strong>.
<Dt> void drain (int secs);
<Dd> This function reads and discards any character for
<strong>secs</strong> seconds.
<Dt> void cvdef (int src, int dst);
<Dd> Defines a converion rule. Every character <strong>src</strong> will be
replaced by <strong>dst</strong>. The conversion is used in <em>csend()</em>.
<Dt> void cvundef (int ch);
<Dd> Undefines the conversion rule for <strong>ch</strong>.
<Dt> void cvinval (int ch);
<Dd> Marks the character <strong>ch</strong> as invalid.
<Dt> string conv (string str);
<Dd> Converts the string <strong>str</strong> using the defined conversion
rules and returns the converted string.
</Dl>

<H2>Lua</H2>
<!-- TODO! -->


<H1 ID="sample">Examples</H1>

Here are some examples that may help you to understand the software a bit
better. First you should read the example configuration file 
<a href="yaps.rc">yaps.rc</a>. This could be used as a base for your own
global configuration file.

<H2>Calling</H2>

Typically the program is called <strong>yaps &lt;pagerid&gt;
&lt;message&gt;</strong>. <em>pagerid</em> is either the exact pagerid of
the receiver or an alias found in the alias section. <em>message</em> is the
message to send by itself. If a pager-id leads to more than one provider,
then the first is used. To force a special service use the <strong>-s
&lt;service&gt;</strong> switch.

<H2>Script protocol</H2>

In the contrib directory, you can find <a href="contrib/tap.sl">tap.sl</a>,
an example on how to use the scripting facility to emulate a protocol. This
is a minimal, but working reimplemetation of TAP.
