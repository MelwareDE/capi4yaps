As this software is in the Alpha state, there are still some bugs or
problems. If you encountered one please include following informations when
reporting it:
- The version you are using.
- Your `Config', `config.h' and `yaps.rc' file.
- Call `yaps -V' and redirect the output into a file. Include this file.
- A command to reproduce the bug.
- The output with the highest verbosity. This can be
  done by starting yaps with several -v's (at least 4) and
  redirecting stdout and stderr into a file, e.g.:
  yaps -vvvv [your options] &> bug              [bash]
  	- or -
  yaps -vvvv [your options] >bug 2>&1           [sh]
  	- or -
  see your shell manual.
- If the program terminates recompile it with debug information
  (if not already done). Reproduce the problem. Start the program
  under the control of the debugger. Save the location and the stack
  frame into a file. Send the file. If a core file is generated, 
  start the debugger on the program/core pair, print the location
  and the stack frame into a file. Send the file.
- DO NOT SEND CORE FILES!!!

Send these information either to <yaps@nitmar.tnet.de> (preferred) or
<ud@cube.net>.
